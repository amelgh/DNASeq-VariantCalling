After mapping the FASTQ file to the reference genome you will end up with a SAM or BAM alignment file

SAM stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format

A single SAM file can store mapped, unmapped, and even QC-failed reads from a sequencing run, and indexed to allow rapid access: this means that the raw sequencing data can be fully recapitulated from the SAM/BAM file.

SAM is rarely helpful and really takes up too much space which is why we use only the BAM in principle

A BAM file (.bam) is the binary version of a SAM file (saving storage and faster manipulation)

You can samtools: a free software package for manipulating SAM/BAM files to manipulate your SAM/BAM files and extract different kinf of information from them:
It does provide utilities for:

|Viewing and formatting|
|----------------------|
|Extracting statistics |
|----------------------|
|Indexing              |
|----------------------|
|Manipulating SAM/BAM files|
|----------------------|
|Editing               |
|----------------------|

```
Usage:  samtools <command> [options]
```
Different samtools options are available here:  http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html

One of the most used tools  since BAM files are often the input files needed for many different analysis programs.
```
samtools view

#from SAM to BAM
samtools view -b test.sam > test.bam
or #if the header is absent from the SAM file
samtools view -bT test.sam > test.bam
or #if the header is header information is available
samtools view -bS test.sam > test.bam
```
```
#from BAM to SAM
samtools view test.bam > test.sam

Use options –h and –H to deal with the header
```
