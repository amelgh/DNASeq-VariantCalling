# DNASeq-VariantCalling
This is a summary of the main classical steps of the DNASeq analysis pipelines leading to the Variant calling step. 
We might need to adapt/customize these different steps to take into consideration the particularities of the study you are performing and the organism you are working on. 
Keep in mind that each tool has a lot of different options, take the time to explore the different possible options and use the ones that are more suitable to you study.

We will be going through the different steps of the classical DNASeq analysis workflow. These session will focus on the case of use of a reference genome to which you will be mapping your samples.
