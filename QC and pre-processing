Keep in mind that you will be generating a lot of files in each step, organizing your data is crucial.

Create a directory Rawdata in which store your fastqfiles.
Create a directory scripts in which you have the different scripts you will be writing for the different analysis steps.
Create a directory Results in which you will be storing your resulting and intermediate files.


The first thing to do when you receive your raw data is to check the quality of your reads. This could be done using the FastQC tool: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
